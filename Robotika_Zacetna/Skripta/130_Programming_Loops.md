# PROGRAMMING LOOPs: FOR-NEXT & WHILE

## Task: REPEAT SOME INSTRUCTIONS

1. If we want to repeat some programming instructions for several times we can use For-Next Loop.
2. For example the next program repeats functions `robotLeft()` and `robotRight()` for `10 times` and robot will do a funny \"dancing\" move.

3. Experiment a bit more with such programming techniques.

## Questions:

1.  What is a programming loop?
2.  Name a situation where programming pool is used.

> ### Repeating Code in Functions
> Using functions may not seem to be very convenient. But it is a huge deal, and helps to make a clean code. It is advised to use functions ether if the code is used only once.

> Where the code is repeated several times in different occasions in the program the use of the functions is trivial.
