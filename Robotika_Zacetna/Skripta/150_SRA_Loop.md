# S-R-A LOOP

## Tasks:

1. Write the program to drive the robot around the class and avoid the
    obstacles.
1. Using the S-R-A loop technique you should write the program in
    particular order:
    1.  Check the sensor. IF the bummper  ...
    2.   ... is pressed the robot has to stop/go back/turn.
    3.   ... is not pressed the robot can drive forward.

## Questions:

1.  Would this routine also work in Arduino run first function (check
    the program in Slide 2)?
2.  <++>

> ## Summary:
> 
> ### Senzoning-Reasoning-Acting Loop
> 
> S-R-A loop is the most important thing in robotics.
> 
> ## Issues:
> 
> ### *It seems that the program is not working right \... like it would be ignoring the value of the sensor.*
> 
> Probably the S-R-A loop is not actually a loop. Check the program if the input is read just onces or is read continuously.
